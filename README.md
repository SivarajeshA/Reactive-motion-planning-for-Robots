# Reactive-motion-planning-for-Robots

Problem statment</br>
Consider an office with 7 rooms for work and one kitchen room. A robot has been entrusted with the
responsibility of collecting used coffee mugs from the rooms and bring them to the kitchen. The robot can carry
only one cup at a time. It keeps on visiting the rooms and if there is an empty cup in a room, it brings it to
the kitchen. If it does not find a cup, it visits another room.
Capture the requirements stated above in the form of an LTL formula. Construct the layout of the office
space based on the layout shown in Figure 2 in [KFP09], where region 1 is the kitchen and region 2-8 are the
office rooms. Then with the help of LTLMoP tool, synthesize a reactive controller for the robot and simulate
its behavior.</br>
